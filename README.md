9DOF Sensor Work

Followed this guide, except used a sample C project instead of C++

Here is the guy's code I used:

NOTE: After you build the project in eclipse, and run it using the remote C/C++ Application run configuration, I was able to get it to run through the terminal on the Edison. Running the chmod 755 ./FILENAME and then ./FILENAME in the Edison terminal made it work.
